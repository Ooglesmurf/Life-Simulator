*Made for the SAP jam.*

Yeah, I stole most this code from random internet tutorials.
<br><br>
I also stole the design by eyeballing a template I was too cheap to pay for.<br>At the very least, I probably gained a slight amount of skill from that.<br>Probably.
<br><br><br><br>
Steal this code if you want; I can't stop you.<br>~~It's not good enough to be useful to you anyways.~~
